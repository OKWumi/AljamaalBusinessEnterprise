												<p>Hello there.... Welcome to my WEBSITE</p>
												<p>My name is <b>OYEKANMI KHADIJAT OMOWUMI,</b> a 500level <em>Pure And Applied Mathematics</em> student of LAUTECH.</p>
												<p>Anyone conversant with the Institution's history must know its's one of the most notorious when it comes to strikes.</p>
												<p>Being a student of knowledge, sitting home and doing nothing is a NO NO which is why i decided to make uptimal use of my time and learn a trade(BAG MAKING) in <b>2016</b> when we had one of our first famous strikes.</p>
												<p>Gaining a benificial knowledge becomes adictive after a while and sometimes you can't help but want to learn more and more when you have the chance which is why i later learnt another trade(GRAPHIC DESIGN) during the covid-19 lockdown.
									   		</p>  
												<p>There are numerous challenges but then everyone does have one or two at a point or the other in their lives, that's life so overcoming them and coming out victorious is the goal.</br>
I have my hands on numerous ventures but these three are my topmost registered deals for now.

						  <li><h3>My experience as a bag maker</h3></li>
						   <p>
						    Being a bag maker... I can categorically say is a dream come true.</br>
						    As a kid, building and joining pieces to give a whole beautiful package is a big deal for me. So living in an environment where as a woman you either learn hairdressing, tailoring, computer operating, catering and leather works.</br> 
						    <p>I chose <b>Leather works</b> which as far as I'm concerned is more connected to my passion at the time than any other.</br> 
						    I learnt the trade rigorously throughout the strike then more flexibly afterwords and continously learn more everyday.</br></p>
						     <p>In 2017, I had a pretty solid foundation on the knows in bag making and  as days go by with more efficient practice and dedication, I continue to improve and excel.</p>

						<li><h3>My experience as a Mentor/Tutor</h3></li>
						<p>Being a Mentor/Tutor is'nt always as easy as some might believe, having people depend on you to deliver meaningful and beneficial knowledge to them can be daunting and stressful at times.</br>But just as students should be dedicated to learning, tutors are also bound to deliver as much and even more than promised which is exactly what strive to do.</p>
						<p>We accepts students based on what they want and how they want it but most especially the level of commitment and effort said student puts into learning.</br> Use this <a href="Al-Jamaal_form.html" style="color: blue;">link</a> to register for some of our available courses.</p>
